        <p>Many people around the world have at one point been victims of the diseases caused by water pollution either after consuming or bathing in polluted water. Some have also suffered after consuming plant or animal food that lives or has been raised by polluted water.

The symptoms of cholera include vomiting, headache and abdominal cramps. In highly polluted areas, one infected person can contaminate the water with the disease causing bacteria and affect the whole population.</p><br>
            <h4>3. Typhoid</h4>

        <h4>2. Diarrhea</h4>
        <p>Diarrhea is a disease that causes frequent and watery bowel movements. It manifests as a result of intestinal infection or food poisoning by drinking contaminated water with pathogens from animal or human waste. In most cases, it is caused by water-borne bacteria, viruses and protozoans and is one of the common diseases caused by water pollution. Diarrhea leads to dehydration, loss of electrolytes, and death to infants and young children.</p><br><br>
        <h4>4. Amoebiasis (Traveller’s Diarrhea)</h4>
        <p>Just like diarrhea, Amoebiasis is among the most prevalent diseases caused by water pollution. Also termed as Traveller’s Diarrhea, one suffers the disease by consuming water contaminated with amoeba protozoa. Apart from infecting the large intestine, it can also infect the liver.
